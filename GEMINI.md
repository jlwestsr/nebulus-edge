# GEMINI Project Context

## Project Overview
**Nebulus Edge** is a production-grade, HIPAA-compliant AI appliance for small businesses handling sensitive data. It runs local LLMs on Apple Silicon via MLX with audit logging, PII detection, and data analytics.

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Project Type**: FULLSTACK Architecture (Brain + Intelligence + Body)
- **LLM Framework**: MLX (Apple Silicon)
- **API**: FastAPI (ports 8080, 8081)
- **Frontend**: Open WebUI (Docker, port 3000)
- **Dependencies**: pip

## Agent Instructions
- **Directives**: Follow the rules in [AI_DIRECTIVES.md](AI_DIRECTIVES.md).
- **Workflow**: Adhere to the process in [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md).
- **Context**: Refer to [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) for deeper architectural details.
- **Long-term memory**: Read and update [docs/AI_INSIGHTS.md](docs/AI_INSIGHTS.md) at the start and end of every session.

## Documentation (Keep In Sync)

Three public-facing documentation surfaces must stay consistent:

1. **README.md** — Primary landing page. SEO-optimized for GitHub search and Google indexing. Contains keyword-rich sections targeting healthcare, legal, finance, and automotive verticals. **Preserve the SEO keyword sections and comparison table when editing.**
2. **GitHub Wiki** — User-facing guides at `https://github.com/jlwestsr/nebulus-edge/wiki`. Cloned locally at `../nebulus-edge.wiki/` (sibling to main repo). Pages: Home, Installation-Guide, Quick-Start, Architecture-Overview, Audit-Logging.
3. **docs/audit_logging.md** — In-repo reference for audit system internals.

**Rules:**
- When a feature ships or behavior changes, update all three locations.
- The wiki repo is separate from the main repo — commit and push it independently (`cd ../nebulus-edge.wiki && git add . && git commit && git push origin master`).
- README changes go through normal develop branch workflow.
- Wiki uses `master` branch (GitHub default for wikis), not `develop`.
